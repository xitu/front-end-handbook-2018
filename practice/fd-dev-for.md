# Front-End Developers Develop For...

A front-end developer crafts HTML, CSS, and JS that typically runs on the [web platform](http://tess.oconnor.cx/2009/05/what-the-web-platform-is)
(e.g. a web browser) delivered from one of the following operating systems (aka OSs):

* Android
* Chromium
* iOS
* OS X
* Ubuntu (or some flavor of Linux)
* Windows Phone
* Windows

These operating systems typically run on one or more of the following devices:

* Desktop computer
* Laptop / netbook computer
* Mobile phone
* Tablet
* TV
* Watch
* [Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) (i.e., anything you can imagine, car, refrigerator, lights, thermostat, etc.)

Generally speaking, front-end technologies can run on the aforementioned operating systems and devices using the following run time web platform scenarios:

* A web browser (examples: [Chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox](http://outdatedbrowser.com/en)).
* A [headless browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser) (examples: [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)).
* A [WebView](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-webview/)/browser tab (think iframe) embedded within a native application as a runtime with bridge to native APIs. WebView applications typically contain a UI constructed from web technologies. (i.e., HTML, CSS, and JS). (examples: [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/))
* A native application built from web tech that is interpreted at runtime with a bridge to native APIs. The UI will make use of native UI parts (e.g., iOS native controls) not web technologies. (examples: [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/))
