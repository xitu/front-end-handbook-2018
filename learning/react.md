###### NOTES:

Once you have a good handle on React move on to learning a more robust state management solution like [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/). If you are an experienced developer with Functional Programming knowledge look at [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). If you need help understanding the role of state management beyond React's `setState` watch, "[Advanced State Management in React (feat. Redux and MobX)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/react-state/)".

Note below the trends in the React Ecosystem (from npm registry) as you move past React and learn tools that work alongside React.
